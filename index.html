            The Science Behind Sound and Water Ejection

Understanding sound frequencies:
In the world of sound, frequency determines the pitch. Low frequencies give us those deep bass sounds, while high frequencies produce sharper, more treble sounds.

The impact of sound on liquid:
Sound waves, especially low-frequency ones, can create vibrations strong enough to move tiny water droplets, pushing them out of confined spaces like a speaker or microphone grid.

The iPhone’s Water Ejection Mechanism

Apple’s approach to water intrusion:
Apple, with its innovative mindset, has found ways to combat the occasional water intrusion, especially in their newer models that boast a level of water resistance.

The role of low-frequency sound:
To address water that might get into the speakers, Apple devised a method where the speaker itself plays a specific low-frequency sound, generating vibrations to push the water out.
